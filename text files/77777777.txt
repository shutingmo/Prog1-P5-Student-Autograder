Dear Old Shiz
The trouble with schools is they always try to teach the wrong lessson. Believe me, I have been kicked out of enough of them to know. They want you to become less callow, less shallow, but I say, why invite stress in? Stop studying strife and learn to live the unexamined life. Dancing through life, skimming the surface, gliding where turf is smooth. Life is more painless for the brianless. Why think too hard when it is so soothing? Dancing through life, no need to tough it when you can slough it off as I do. Nothing mattters, but knowing nothing matters. It is just life, so keep dancing through.
