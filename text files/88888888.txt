Dear Old Shiz
Something has changed within me. Something is not the same. I am through with playing by the rules of someone elses game. Too late for second guessing. Too late to go back to sleep. It is time to trust my instincts, close my eyes, and leap. It is time to try defying gravity. I think I will try defying gravity and you can not pull me down. I am through accepting limits because someone says they are so. Some things I cannot change, but till I try, I will never know. Too long I have been afraid of losing love I guess I have lost. Well, if that is love, it comes at much too high a cost. I would sooner buy defying gravity. Kiss me goodbye. I am defying gravity and you can not pull me down.
