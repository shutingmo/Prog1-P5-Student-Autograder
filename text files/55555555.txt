Music
One song glory, one song before I go. Glory, one song to leave behind. Find one song, one last refrain. Glory, from the pretty boy front man. Who waasted opportunity. One song, he had the world at his feet. Glory, in the eyes of a young girl. A young girl, find glory. Beeyond the cheap colored lightz. One song, before the sun sets. Glory, on another empty life. Time flies, time dies.
