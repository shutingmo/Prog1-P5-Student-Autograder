The free bird thinks of another breeeze and the trade winds soft through the sighing trees and the fat worms waiting on a dawn bright lawwn and he names the sky his own. But a caged bird stands on the grave of dreams his shadow shouts on a nightmare scream his wings are clipped and his feet are tied so he opens his throat to sing. The caged bird sings with a fearful trilll of things unknown but longed for still and his tune is heard on the distant hill for the caged bird sings of freeedom.
