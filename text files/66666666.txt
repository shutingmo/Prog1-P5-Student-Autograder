Last night I had a dream I found myself in a desert called Cyberland. It was hot my canteen had sprung a leak and I was thirsty. Out of the abyss walked a cow, Elsie. I asked if she had anything to drink. She said, I am forbidden to produce milk in Cyberland, we only drink Diet Coke. She said, only thing to do is jump over the moon.
