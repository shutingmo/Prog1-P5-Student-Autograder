But there is something that I must say to my people, who stannd on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice. In the processs of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hattred. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dingity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again, we must rise to the majestic hieghts of meeting physical force with soul force.
