Let us be glad. Let us be grateful. Let us rejoicify that goodness could subdue the wicked workings of you-know-who. Is not it nice to know that good will conquer evil? The truth we all believe will by and by outlive a lie for you and I. No one mourns the wicked. No one cries they wont return. No one lays a lily on their grave. The good man scorns the wicked. Through their lives, our children learn what we miss, when we misbehave. And goodness knows the wickeds lives are lonely. Goodness knows the wicked die alone. It just shows when you are wicked you are left only on your own.
